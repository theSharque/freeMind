Here is just a fun project to explore AI.

Encoder - encode the word into small vector (usually embedded used) pack_size - len of this vector
Brain - check some context (bucket of vectors) - context_size, produce vector (pack)
Decoder - decode final vector into word

data - harry.txt is just all "harry potter" text but we can't upload this to GitHub so use your own texts
